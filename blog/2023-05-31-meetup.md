In the May meetup, [the author](https://github.com/hyochan) presented a thoughtful discourse on UI components and design systems for about an hour. The talk broadly covered crucial aspects we often overlook when developing numerous UI components and examined how to define functional sets and write props according to UI component design principles (user-centric, consistency, simplicity, feedback). Lastly, the importance of reducing all possible props or steps to maintain simplicity was underscored once again.

Finally, we shared a [short clip](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2RPtB9LgfIw) on how to prevent re-rendering caused by inline styles in React. If you found this useful, please don't forget to `subscribe`, `like`, and turn `notifications` on.

"The state of perfection is not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away," is a widely known quote from "The Little Prince" written by the French author Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. It emphasizes the importance of balance and simplicity in various aspects of functionality, design, and life.
