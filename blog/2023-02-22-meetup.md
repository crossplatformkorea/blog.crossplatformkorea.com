At this meetup, there was a small [presentation on the Flutter GetX pattern](https://youtu.be/vD8ldHv5D6Q). Then, we shared the toy Flutter project which was developed to manage meetup donations. The project name is `WeCount` and [sourcecode is on Github](https://github.com/crossplatformkorea/wecount).

In addition, some apps made with Cross-Platforms are listed in [crossplatform/koreanapps.md](https://github.com/crossplatformkorea/koreanapps.md). If there's an app you'd like to add, please push a `PR`.
