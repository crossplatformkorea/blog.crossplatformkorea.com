The first Cross-Platform Korea meetup was held. In 2023, there should be more beneficial knowledge sharing time.
First of all, since it was the first day, I, the organizer, continued my presentation while looking back at the React Native Seoul meetup last year.

There was [a retrospective of last year's meetup and a return for the informative presentations made at the end of the year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9h1dVzRIA&list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&index=2).

Since there was no winner by voting, it was determined by the number of likes and views on YouTube, and a prize of 500,000 won was given to the team that announced the [FlatLane automated distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnTh4iCEiNo&list=PLMu8UG37vF6oJLNhjsjoy_ApcJFZZwJOo).

Youngji Noh, the leader, was unable to attend, so the agent awarded the prize money.<br/>

Next, I shared my experience on [How to handle Navigation in Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9h1dVzRIA&list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&index=2). It deals with the experience of built-in navigation and Go Router, and contains knowledge that is good to know in advance when choosing navigation in Flutter.

Then, we shared [How to handle navigation in React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7uiKmfS1Wo&list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&index=4) and looked into what React Native is trying to do.
