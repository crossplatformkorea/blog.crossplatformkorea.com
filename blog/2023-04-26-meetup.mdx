In the April meetup, we continued with content related to [Microsoft's MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui?view=net-maui-7.0) following the February Flutter meetup. First, Park Tae-sung from Idea Sam shared his [thoughts on MAUI as a React Native developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JKgfVz_Q_4).

Secondly, Kim Sang-Hyun from Some Other Place gave a presentation. The title of the presentation was [MAUI, a Native-friendly Cross-platform, This is It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgO6KIHc5OU), and you can check the content through the link. The presentation mainly focuses on how MAUI is different from React Native and Flutter.

We provide a presentation fee of $150 to the speakers, and the presentation can be casually given for 15 to 50 minutes at your discretion. If you are interested, please proceed through the [presentation application form](https://forms.gle/x6oAt28FnepAAJtp6). Thank you üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
