            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this conference, we delved deeply into introducing 'tRPC' and its usage. tRPC assists in constructing End-to-end typesafe APIs more efficiently. Through this technology, we discussed the specific ways in which project implementation can be simplified.</p>
<p>The presentation by Kim Chanwoo, the representative of the AI English education startup 'SetaOne Korea', and former Tech Lead Shin Eunsoo was particularly noteworthy. They generously shared their experiences and insights from developing their product using tRPC. This gave a real-world example, illustrating how tRPC played a pivotal role when SetaOne successfully launched their initial MVP.</p>
<p>Kim Chanwoo discussed the patents related to AI English learning he worked on at LXPER, while Shin Eunsoo emphasized the utility of tRPC, drawing from her diverse experiences in various startups.</p>
<p>Importantly, this conference was enriched by various discussions and a QnA session. Thanks to the passionate participation and in-depth questions from the attendees, the debates were more vibrant and substantial than ever before.</p>
<p>Through this conference, we clearly grasped the significance and practicality of tRPC. The experiences and expertise shared by the presenters vividly showcased how tRPC can be applied in real-world settings. Especially, the case study of SetaOne Korea depicted a concrete and successful model of leveraging tRPC.</p>
<p>Lastly, heartfelt thanks to everyone who attended this conference. We look forward to continuously sharing valuable information and experiences in our upcoming events!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hermes is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Facebook, specifically designed to improve the startup time of React Native apps. It was first introduced in React Native 0.60.4 in 2019.</p>
<p>React Native apps are typically written in JavaScript, and this code is interpreted by a JavaScript engine before being executed on a device. Previously, most React Native apps used JSC (JavaScriptCore) for code interpretation. However, with an aim to enhance performance, especially for mobile apps, Facebook introduced Hermes.</p>
<p>The key features and advantages of Hermes are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fast Startup Time</strong>: As Hermes directly executes JavaScript compiled into bytecode, it enhances the app's startup time.</li>
<li><strong>Low Memory Footprint</strong>: Hermes is designed to minimize memory usage, thereby reducing the overall memory consumption of the app.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for React Native</strong>: Hermes is optimized for use with React Native, offering potential performance improvements for typical React Native operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, check out the blog <a href="https://medium.com/crossplatformkorea/hermes-%EC%97%94%EC%A7%84%EC%9D%B4%EB%9E%80-cbeb953e0f10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is Hermes Engine?</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code>React Native Architecture</code> refers to the internal structure and operating principles of a React Native application. The initial architecture of React Native consisted of several main components, and over time, enhancements and updates were made to improve the performance and stability of the application. This explanation is based on information up to 2021.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Bridge</strong>: This was a core component of React Native's initial architecture. The Bridge facilitated communication between the JavaScript thread and the Native thread. It was responsible for sending UI updates, events, etc., generated in JavaScript, to the Native code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JavaScript Core (JSC)</strong>: This is the JavaScript engine used in iOS. In Android, the JSC is bundled for distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Native Modules</strong>: These are modules in React Native applications that provide access to the native features of a device. For instance, they allow access to the camera, GPS, and file system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Facebook is continuously working to improve the performance and flexibility of React Native's architecture. New architectural updates, like "Fabric" and "TurboModules," have been introduced.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fabric</strong>: This is a project to rewrite the UI layer of React Native. It aims to achieve faster UI updates and smoother animations. Fabric minimizes the communication between JavaScript and Native, thereby enhancing performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TurboModules</strong>: These are a rewritten version of Native Modules, aiming to improve the communication performance between the JavaScript thread and the Native thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The introduction of this new architecture aims to boost the performance of React Native applications and streamline their integration with Native components.</p>

If you found this useful, please don't forget to <code>subscribe</code>, <code>like</code>, and turn <code>notifications</code> on.</p>
<p>"The state of perfection is not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away," is a widely known quote from "The Little Prince" written by the French author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It emphasizes the importance of balance and simplicity in various aspects of functionality, design, and life.</p>
<p>We offer a presentation fee of $150 to our presenters, and the presentation contents can be casually delivered at your discretion for 20 to 50 minutes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Florian Ludot, the CTO of Avanssion Inc., gave a presentation introducing Storybook, a tool that helps developers build scalable and effective services. During the presentation, he guided the audience through the Storybook workflow, from the initial design phase to implementation, deployment, publishing and integration of component libraries, and shared tips and best practices for iterating products at lightning speed. He also emphasized the importance of innovating the UI development process and taking projects to the next level.</p>
<p>Florian Ludot was born and raised in France, spent four years in Japan, and recently moved to Seoul as a developer. He expressed his delight in having had fantastic opportunities to work closely with development and design teams, and to share his knowledge with anyone interested in learning more about the field. He also announced that he is preparing the Seoul iOS Meetup, where everyone is welcome to gather and share knowledge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first Cross-Platform Korea meetup was held. In 2023, there should be more beneficial knowledge sharing time.
First of all, since it was the first day, I, the organizer, continued my presentation while looking back at the React Native Seoul meetup last year.</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27461460/215254735-c2646085-bf23-47d2-8bf0-913f764f7808.png" width="800">
<p>There was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9h1dVzRIA&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&amp;index=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a retrospective of last year's meetup and a return for the informative presentations made at the end of the year.</a>.</p>
<p>Since there was no winner by voting, it was determined by the number of likes and views on YouTube, and a prize of 500,000 won was given to the team that announced the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnTh4iCEiNo&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6oJLNhjsjoy_ApcJFZZwJOo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlatLane automated distribution</a>.</p>
<p>Youngji Noh, the leader, was unable to attend, so the agent awarded the prize money.<br></p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27461460/215254744-82769df0-0b40-4bdd-8094-223fa258ca38.png" width="360">
<p>Next, I shared my experience on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9h1dVzRIA&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&amp;index=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to handle Navigation in Flutter</a>. It deals with the experience of built-in navigation and Go Router, and contains knowledge that is good to know in advance when choosing navigation in Flutter.</p>
<p>Then, we shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7uiKmfS1Wo&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&amp;index=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to handle navigation in React Native</a> and looked into what React Native is trying to do.</p>

<p>The first announcement was made by Hyungu Kang, a developer at Sandbird. We learned in detail about FlatList, which is often used in React Native, and how to optimize it. The presentation video is attached at the link below.</p>

<p>The second presentation was made by Noh Young-ji, who works at Connect Dream. You shared how to automate app builds and deployments with Fastlane. Please check the presentation video at the link below.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't share the rest of the presentation because the video was cut off, but I would also like to thank Lee Tae-heon for sharing how to use Naver Map.</p>
<p>As promised, a prize of 500,000 won will be given to the team that proceeded with the presentation. Prizes will be awarded at the next meetup on January 25th :)</p>
