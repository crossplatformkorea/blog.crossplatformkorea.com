            <description><![CDATA[In the May meetup, the author presented a thoughtful discourse on UI components and design systems for about an hour. The talk broadly covered crucial aspects we often overlook when developing numerous UI components and examined how to define functional sets and write props according to UI component design principles (user-centric, consistency, simplicity, feedback).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the May meetup, <a href="https://github.com/hyochan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the author</a> presented a thoughtful discourse on UI components and design systems for about an hour. The talk broadly covered crucial aspects we often overlook when developing numerous UI components and examined how to define functional sets and write props according to UI component design principles (user-centric, consistency, simplicity, feedback). Lastly, the importance of reducing all possible props or steps to maintain simplicity was underscored once again.</p><p>Finally, we shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2RPtB9LgfIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short clip</a> on how to prevent re-rendering caused by inline styles in React. If you found this useful, please don't forget to <code>subscribe</code>, <code>like</code>, and turn <code>notifications</code> on.</p><p>"The state of perfection is not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away," is a widely known quote from "The Little Prince" written by the French author Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. It emphasizes the importance of balance and simplicity in various aspects of functionality, design, and life.</p><p>We offer a presentation fee of $100 to our presenters, and the presentation contents can be casually delivered at your discretion for 15 to 50 minutes. If you're interested, please proceed through our <a href="https://forms.gle/x6oAt28FnepAAJtp6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presentation application form</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first Cross-Platform Korea meetup was held. In 2023, there should be more beneficial knowledge sharing time.
First of all, since it was the first day, I, the organizer, continued my presentation while looking back at the React Native Seoul meetup last year.</p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27461460/215254735-c2646085-bf23-47d2-8bf0-913f764f7808.png" width="800" class="img_ev3q"><p>There was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9h1dVzRIA&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&amp;index=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a retrospective of last year's meetup and a return for the informative presentations made at the end of the year.</a>.</p><p>Since there was no winner by voting, it was determined by the number of likes and views on YouTube, and a prize of 500,000 won was given to the team that announced the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnTh4iCEiNo&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6oJLNhjsjoy_ApcJFZZwJOo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlatLane automated distribution</a>.</p><p>Youngji Noh, the leader, was unable to attend, so the agent awarded the prize money.<br></p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27461460/215254744-82769df0-0b40-4bdd-8094-223fa258ca38.png" width="360" class="img_ev3q"><p>Next, I shared my experience on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9h1dVzRIA&amp;list=PLMu8UG37vF6p5betw-J2_b4IdXSE01HvH&amp;index=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to handle Navigation in Flutter</a>.
