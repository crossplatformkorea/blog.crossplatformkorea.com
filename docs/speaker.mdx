We are looking for speakers for the cross-platform Korea meetup! Any cross-platform topic, such as React Native, Flutter, or MAUI, is fine.
The presentation can be conducted in a light amount of about 30 minutes.

Presenters are given a small amount of goods and $100 in support from the community. However, you must submit your presentation video (recording your laptop screen with voice included) to the community.

Please apply through the [Speaker Application](https://forms.gle/x6oAt28FnepAAJtp6). Thank you 🙇🏻‍♂️
