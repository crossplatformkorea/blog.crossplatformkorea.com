We are looking for speakers for the cross-platform Korea meetup! Any cross-platform topic, such as React Native, Flutter, or MAUI, is fine.
The presentation can be conducted in a light amount of about 30 minutes.

Presenters are given a small amount of goods and $150 in support from the community. However, you must submit your presentation video (recording your laptop screen with voice included) to the community.

Please apply through [crossplatformkorea@gmail.com](mailto:crossplatformkorea@gmail.com). Thank you 🙇🏻‍♂️

In your email, please include the following information:
- Name
- Phone number
- Session title
- Session outline
- Preferred presentation date
- Social media links you'd like to share (website, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc.)
