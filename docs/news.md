## February
The meetup is scheduled for Wednesday, Feb 22th from 7:30pm to 9:50pm.
You can [apply for the meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ko-KR/crossplatformkorea/
events/291351883).

On the day, there will be a presentation on Flutter Application with GetX pattern and networking by group. While networking, you will be able to freely talk, set missions, and contribute to future meetups.
Any activity is irrelevant as long as the mission is to share cross-platform knowledge to community. I would appreciate it if you could confirm with the operator in advance.

## January

From January 25, 2023, the name of the meetup will be changed from React Native Seoul to Cross-Platform Korea.
Since React Native is a cross-platform technology after all, and Flutter and MAUI can also develop services while responding to multiple platforms in a similar way, we saw that there are many opportunities to broaden our knowledge and communicate.

I hope that future meetups will be more beneficial and interesting to all of you.

## [meetup]

The next meetup is scheduled for Wednesday, January 25th from 7:30pm to 9:30pm. The meetup application will be held in early January.

Happy New Year and see you on the event day üòÅ
