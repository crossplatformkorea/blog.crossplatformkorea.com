## 1. React Navigation

[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) is among the most popular navigation libraries in React Native.

### Advantages
- Implemented in JavaScript, ensuring good compatibility across various platforms.
- Easy customization.
- Active community support.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

There are various navigator types such as Stack, Tab, Drawer. Here's an example of StackNavigator:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/stack
```

### Usage

```javascript
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

## 2. React Native Navigation

[React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/) is a router library based on native modules and developed by Wix.

### Advantages
- Since it's based on native modules, it offers better performance.
- Utilizes native UI components for rendering, enabling smoother animations.

### Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-navigation
```

Then, connect the native module.

### Usage

```javascript
import { Navigation } from 'react-native-navigation';

Navigation.registerComponent('Home', () => HomeScreen);
Navigation.registerComponent('Details', () => DetailsScreen);

Navigation.events().registerAppLaunchedListener(() => {
  Navigation.setRoot({
    root: {
      stack: {
        children: [
          {
            component: {
              name: 'Home'
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  });
});
```

Both libraries have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. It's essential to choose the appropriate library based on the project requirements and preferences.
