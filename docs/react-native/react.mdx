React Native is a framework for mobile app development, based on the fundamental principles of React. Understanding React's core concepts greatly assists in using React Native effectively.

## React for React Native

In this article, we'll delve into React's core concepts and see how they apply to React Native.

### 1. Component

Components are the core of both React and React Native. They are reusable units that make up the UI and are independent and recyclable.

**React Example:**

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

**React Native Example:**

```javascript
import { Text } from 'react-native';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <Text>Hello, {props.name}</Text>;
}
```

### 2. State & Props

React components manage data through `state` and `props`. `Props` are data passed down from parent components, while `state` represents data that can change within a component.


Components can have their own state and properties (props), and the UI of a React application is composed of a combination of these components. Components can be defined either as functional or class-based. In modern React applications, functional components are predominantly used.

When designing components in React, `props` and `state` are two crucial concepts. These two help define how a component processes and displays information.

#### props (Properties)

**props** is short for "properties".

1. **Information Transfer**: `props` are used to pass information from a parent component to a child component.
2. **Read-only**: `props` cannot be modified within a component. In other words, a component must use the `props` as they are received.
3. **Example**: Imagine giving someone your business card to convey your name. The information on that card doesn't change. Similarly, `props` passed to a component can be thought of as unchangeable information.

#### state (Status)

**state** is information managed within the component.

1. **Changeable**: `state` can change over time. It can be updated for various reasons, such as user interactions or receiving new data from a server.
2. **Internally Managed**: `state` is managed only within the component, and it cannot be directly modified from outside.
3. **Example**: Imagine things like your mood or thoughts, which can change as time passes. The component's `state` manages information that can change over time in a similar way.

To summarize briefly:

> **props**: Information received from the parent that cannot be changed.
> - Official Documentation: [Passing Props to a Component](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)

> **state**: Information managed within the component that can change depending on time or circumstances.
> - Official Documentation: [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)

**React Native Example:**

```ts
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, Button } from 'react-native';

function Counter(): JSX.Element {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increase" onPress={increment} />
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### 3. Lifecycle & Hooks

Lifecycle methods are used in class components and get executed at specific times during a component's life. In function components, similar functionalities can be achieved using `Hooks`.

**React Native Hooks Example:**

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Executes when the component mounts or updates.
    console.log('Component updated!');

    return () => {
      // Executes when the component will unmount.
      console.log('Component will unmount!');
    };
  }, [count]); // Executes every time 'count' changes.

  return <Text>{count}</Text>;
}
```

These fundamental concepts of React apply directly to React Native. Building on these React principles allows for more effective mobile app development in React Native. Thus, a solid grasp of React's fundamentals will naturally lead to a smoother transition to React Native.
