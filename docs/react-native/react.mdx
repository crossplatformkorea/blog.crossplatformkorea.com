React Native is a framework for mobile app development, based on the fundamental principles of React. Understanding React's core concepts greatly assists in using React Native effectively.

## React for React Native

In this article, we'll delve into React's core concepts and see how they apply to React Native.

### 1. Component

Components are the core of both React and React Native. They are reusable units that make up the UI and are independent and recyclable.

**React Example:**

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

**React Native Example:**

```javascript
import { Text } from 'react-native';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <Text>Hello, {props.name}</Text>;
}
```

### 2. State & Props

React components manage data through `state` and `props`. `Props` are data passed down from parent components, while `state` represents data that can change within a component.

**React Native Example:**

```javascript
import { Text, Button } from 'react-native';

class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  };

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>
        <Button title="Increase" onPress={this.increment} />
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

### 3. Lifecycle & Hooks

Lifecycle methods are used in class components and get executed at specific times during a component's life. In function components, similar functionalities can be achieved using `Hooks`.

**React Native Hooks Example:**

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Executes when the component mounts or updates.
    console.log('Component updated!');

    return () => {
      // Executes when the component will unmount.
      console.log('Component will unmount!');
    };
  }, [count]); // Executes every time 'count' changes.

  return <Text>{count}</Text>;
}
```

These fundamental concepts of React apply directly to React Native. Building on these React principles allows for more effective mobile app development in React Native. Thus, a solid grasp of React's fundamentals will naturally lead to a smoother transition to React Native.
