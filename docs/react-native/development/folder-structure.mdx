Deciding on a folder structure is still a significant challenge for many developers in the development process. Let's take a look at the structure of a project started with dooboo-cli.

### 1. App Directory
<img src={ImgFolderApp} alt="img-folder-app" width={320}/>
The App directory is an essential part of file-based routing.
This directory should be understood as a collection of the top-level components that make up each screen.
It may include various tab routers that bundle screens, but the basic concept remains the same.

### 2. Assets Directory
<img src={ImgFolderAssets} alt="img-folder-assets" width={320}/>
The Assets directory is where images, fonts, and other resources used in the app are collected.
It's a crucial part for managing the resources of the app, even though it does not directly affect code execution.

### 3. Src Directory
The Src directory is responsible for the core functions of the app.
It includes the store for managing the app's state, providers for enabling state changes, custom UI components, utility functions, and constants, strings, themes used in the app.

- The `apis` sub-directory seen in the above screen is where APIs used in the app are collected. This includes code for communicating with servers using tools like [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) or [axios](https://axios-http.com/kr/docs/intro).
- The `providers` sub-directory is where providers used in the app are collected. Providers manage the app's state and enable state changes. They can be implemented using tools like [Redux](https://redux.js.org), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html), [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org).
