To initiate our project, we utilize [dooboo-cli](https://github.com/dooboolab/dooboo-cli). This tool efficiently integrates necessary components to facilitate project commencement and has been consistently maintained for 7 years, reflecting the latest tech stack.

## Creating the Project

First, enter the following command in a terminal where Node.js is properly installed. Those who have followed the instructions in the 'Development Environment' section should already have the necessary environment set up.

```bash
npx dooboo init
```

<img src={ImgDoobooInit} alt="dooboo-init" />

Then, input the project name in PascalCase as shown below, and the project will be created.

<img src={ImgDoobooInitRun1} alt="dooboo-init-run-1" />
