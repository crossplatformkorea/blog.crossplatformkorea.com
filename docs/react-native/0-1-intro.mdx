## Introduction

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. This framework allows developers to use JavaScript and React to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.

The key features of React Native include:

1. **Learn once, write anywhere**: React Native adopts the philosophy of 'learn once, write anywhere.' This means that developers can develop applications for various platforms such as iOS and Android by learning JavaScript and React just once.

2. **Native Components**: React Native enhances the user experience by using native components. This ensures that applications run smoothly and provide the 'feel' of the respective platform.

3. **Live and Hot Reloading**: React Native supports live and hot reloading features. This allows developers to modify code and instantly see the results, making the development process faster and more efficient.

4. **Community and Ecosystem**: React Native has a robust community and ecosystem. There are numerous third-party libraries and tools available, enabling developers to quickly build applications tailored to their needs.

For these reasons, many companies use React Native for the development of their mobile applications. Notably, this includes major corporations such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/), and [Wix](https://www.wix.com/).
