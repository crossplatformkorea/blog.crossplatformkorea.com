In React Native, there are various routers like [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) and [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation). However, in our community, we recommend [expo-router](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction).
This recommendation isn't merely because it's the latest router available, but because it's a file-based router. This not only helps in eliminating unnecessary code but also results in more concise and intuitive code.

## Expo Router

**Expo Router** is a file-based router designed for **Universal React Native** applications built with **Expo**.
This router allows for managing screen transitions in both **React Native** and web applications, facilitating smooth navigation for users across different parts of the app's UI.
Through this, it's possible to manage screen transitions within an app using the same components across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, and web).

Detailed information on how to use Expo Router can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction).
This document explains how to manage screen transitions using Expo Router.
For instance, the following code demonstrates how to navigate between the `HomeScreen` and `ProfileScreen`.

```tsx
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { Button } from 'react-native';

function HomeScreen() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <Button
      title="Go to Profile"
      onPress={() => {
        navigation.navigate('Profile', { name: 'Jane' });
      }}
    />
  );
}

function ProfileScreen({ route }) {
  return <Text>This is {route.params.name}'s profile</Text>;
}
```

In the code above, the `useNavigation` hook is employed to retrieve the `navigation` object, followed by rendering the `Button` component.
Upon triggering the `onPress` handler, the `navigation.navigate` method is invoked to transition to the `ProfileScreen`.
At this juncture, the `name` parameter is passed along. Within the `ProfileScreen`, the `name` parameter is accessed using `route.params.name`.
